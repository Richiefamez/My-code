           <ul>
            <li>
                ECH IS NOT A BANK, and as a regulated securities broker dealer, we cannot carry securities classified as HTM (Held To Maturity), which are not required to be marked to market on a bank's books. We also cannot make unsecured, long-term loans.
            </li>
            <li>
                The only kind of loans we can make are margin loans fully secured by marketable securities.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our real-time margining system marks all client positions to market continuously. All orders are credit vetted before being executed and positions in accounts with inadequate margin deposits are liquidated automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
                ALL of our positions are marked to market daily and the resulting payables/receivables are reconciled to outside sources automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
                ECH invests cash in very short-term investments maturing within a few months. We hold no material positions in over-the-counter securities or derivatives. We hold no CDOs, MBS or CDS.

                On a consolidated basis, ECH LLC exceeds $12.9 billion in equity capital, over $9.0 billion in excess of regulatory requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                ECH LLC's owners are our public company, Earncell Hoards Brokers Group, Inc. (24.5%) and the firm's employees and their affiliates (75.5%). Unlike at most other firms, where management owns a relatively small share, we participate substantially in the downside just as much as in the upside. Because of this vested interest, we run our business conservatively.
              </li>
              <li>
                ECH LLC reported $2.0 billion of pretax profit for 2022.
              </li>
              <li>
                IBG LLC has no long-term debt.

        <h1>Important Strength and Security Facts about Earncell Hoards Brokers LLC</h1>
        <h2>How We Handle Client Assets</h2>
        <p>
            A portion (approximately 8% at March 10, 2023) of client money is segregated in special bank or custody accounts, which are designated for the exclusive benefit of clients of ECH. This <br> protection (the SEC term is "reserve" and the CFTC term is "segregation") is a core principle of securities and commodities brokerage. By properly segregating the client's assets, if no money <br> or stock is borrowed and no futures positions are held by the client, then the client's assets are available to be returned to the client in the event of a default by or bankruptcy of the broker.

            As <br> a practice, ECH places a portion of its own money in these reserve and segregated accounts to ensure that there is more than enough cash to protect all clients.

            A majority (approximately <br> 92% at March 10, 2023) of client funds is typically invested in short-term U.S. Treasury <br> securities and reverse repurchase agreements, where the collateral received is in the form of U.S. Treasury securities. ECH’s investment policy targets short-term government securities and <br> reverse repurchase agreements, with a typical weighted average maturity of 30 to 40 days and a maximum term of one year. In this way, we can avoid mismatching the maturities between our <br> on-demand obligations to our clients and our investments. This practice also allows us to avoid excessive price volatility and the risks of large losses stemming from declines in investment values <br> that may be exhibited by longer term securities. As a broker dealer, we must mark to market the value of investments of client funds daily, unlike banks that may hold securities classified as “held to <br> maturity”, which are not required to be marked to market.

            Although permitted by CFTC regulations, given the credit concerns over foreign sovereign debt ECH does not currently invest any client <br> money in money market funds.
